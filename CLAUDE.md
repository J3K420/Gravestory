# GraveStory — CLAUDE.md

## What this app does

GraveStory is a mobile-first PWA for cemetery visitors. The user photographs a gravestone; the app runs it through AI to produce a biographical story about the person buried there.

**Core flow:**
1. User taps "Scan a Gravestone" → camera or photo library
2. App extracts EXIF GPS from the photo (with permission)
3. Gemini pre-flight: verifies the photo actually shows a gravestone
4. Gemini OCR: reads names, dates, inscription, symbols → structured JSON
5. Parallel research: Tavily web search + WikiTree genealogy + Wikipedia
6. Nominatim/Overpass: geocodes the cemetery (text → lat/lng → named grave node if in OSM)
7. Gemini biography: generates a compassionate narrative from all sources
8. User can save, share, and view the story on a per-cemetery Leaflet map
9. Signed-in users can make stories public → community global map

## Architecture conventions

### Classic scripts — no ES modules

All JS files load as `<script src>` tags in `index.html`. No `import`/`export`. Every top-level `function` declaration auto-attaches to `window`. Inline `onclick` attributes in HTML resolve against `window` at click time.

**Rule:** use `function` declarations (not `const fn = ...`) for anything callable from HTML or other modules.

### Load order matters

Scripts are ordered leaf-first in `index.html`:
- `config.js` always first (provides `PROXY_BASE`)
- Utility and API modules before their callers
- `auth.js` must come after the Supabase CDN `<script>` tag (constructs `supabaseClient` at parse time)

### `index.html` owns the orchestration core

The main pipeline (`startAnalysis`, `handleImageUpload`, `showScreen`, `uploadImageToR2`, `getDeviceLocation`, `forwardGeocode`) and all shared state (`currentStory`, `savedStories`, `currentImage`, `currentExifLocation`, `locationPermission`, `_bypassVerification`) live in the inline `<script>` block inside `index.html`. Extracted modules read and write these via plain identifier references (shared lexical scope).

### Stage-based extraction refactor

The codebase has been systematically extracted from a monolithic `index.html` into separate files across numbered stages (currently **Stage 13**). Each extracted module has a header block documenting:
- Public API surface
- External symbols consumed
- Load-order requirements
- Timing-safety audit (what runs at parse time vs DOMContentLoaded vs call time)

Follow this pattern when extracting more code.

### All API secrets stay server-side

No API keys in client JS. Every sensitive call routes through `PROXY_BASE` (Cloudflare Worker). The only client-side config is `PROXY_BASE` in `config.js`.

### Gemini call pattern

- Primary model: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
- Auto-fallback to `gemini-2.5-flash` on HTTP 503, 429, network errors, or overload response bodies
- All Gemini calls use `temperature: 0.1` for deterministic output
- All prompts instruct the model to return **only valid JSON** — parsed via `safeParseJSON` with a sensible default object

### Supabase data model

Stories table uses:
- Soft-delete (`deleted_at` timestamp, not hard DELETE)
- `is_public` flag for community sharing
- `updated_at` for incremental sync (`syncDelta` pulls only rows newer than the last high-water mark)
- `pushLocalOnly` heals stranded guest saves on sign-in

### CSS approach

One CSS file per screen/component. CSS custom properties in `base.css`. No preprocessor.

**Design language — dark gothic:**
- Background: `#1a1410` (near-black warm brown)
- Gold accent: `#c9a84c`
- Warm cream text: `#e8d4a0`
- Headings: Playfair Display (serif)
- Body/UI: Crimson Pro (serif)

### Mobile-first PWA

Built for one-handed use in a cemetery. Service worker caches the app shell (`gravestory-v12`) and Leaflet map tiles separately. iOS users get a manual "Add to Home Screen" hint (Safari doesn't support `beforeinstallprompt`).

## Key behaviors to preserve

- **Gravestone verification before OCR** — `verifyIsGravestone` runs first; throws `{ __verificationRejection: true, reason }` if the photo isn't a gravestone. `startAnalysis` catches this and renders a rejection screen with a "Use it anyway" escape hatch (sets `_bypassVerification = true`).

- **Stone-only biography fallback** — if Tavily and WikiTree both return nothing, `generateBiography` returns a short paragraph from the inscription alone *without* calling Gemini, preventing hallucination.

- **Geographic context filter in geocoding** — `forwardGeocode` extracts city/state tokens from the AI-returned location string and requires them in Nominatim results, preventing cross-city false matches.

- **Low-confidence pin flag** — if Nominatim resolves a cemetery to a different US state than the query specified, the map pin gets a `_lowConfidence` badge instead of silently showing a wrong location.

- **Grave-node cache** — `grave-cache.js` caches successful Overpass name-match results so the same person's grave isn't re-queried on subsequent map opens.

- **Soft-delete sync** — deletes propagate to other devices via `deleted_at` in the delta sync, not through missing rows.
